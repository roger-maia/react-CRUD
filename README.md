This is an example of a React CRUD [Create, Read, Update, Delete] application using a simulated API to manage a list of tasks 

This example provides a simple web application that allows you to perform CRUD operations on tasks.

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, you can download and install them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Let´s go to create a React CRUD application:

Create a new React app using Create React App (I Suggest you use VsCode download on https://code.visualstudio.com/)

1. You need to create the app
   
   npx create-react-app react-crud-app
   cd react-crud-app

3. Replace the contents of src/App.js with the downloaded code
   
4. The example, I´m using hooks to manage the state of tasks, newTask, and editTask. I simulated the API calls with mock data. This option of the app: to add, edit, and delete tasks.

5. To start the App server, run:
    npm start

I´ll run the React app, and you need to access it in your web browser.
You can add, edit, and delete tasks using the provided UI.
Please, you need to improve this example, I appreciate that.
